        The Journey So Far
      </h2>
      <p>
        I am a former Automotive Technician with a passion for computer programming. Many years ago while attending college I took
        my first computer science class and immediately fell in love. I really enjoy technically work which was what initially
        brought me to the automotive industry. After many years in the industry, I decided it was time to make a change back
        to computer programming. I decided to attended Front Range Community college to learn the core computer science fundamentals.
        These fundamentals were taught using C++ and covered Object Oriented Programming, data structures, algorithms and
        the Standard template library. After completion of the computer programming certificate offered by Front Range, I
        decided it was time to learn a framework. I have always been curious about the web so I joined Thinkful. While at
        Thinkful, I learned full stack JavaScript programming and built three portfolio pieces that demonstrate these skills.
        It’s been an amazing journey so far and I am ready to take these skills to the next level by joining a team of Software
        Engineers.

          Technician Assist is an automotive service department tool designed to increase the customer experience through accurate
          diagnostics and repairs. Technician Assist gets the service experience started right by initiating communication
          between the customer, the advisor and the technician before the customers appointment. The app is a survey system
          that allows the customer to answer a series of questions designed to gather more information about the issues the
          customer is experiencing.
